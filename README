I use a "package users" system as described by Matthias S. Benkmann in
"more control and package management using package users".

Some files are hand-edited by me, usually as root, and I'd rather they
were owned by a different user than "root".

Unless otherwise specified, files are copyright Eric Herman, and made
avaiable as Free Software under the terms of the GPL[1] version 3 or
later.
